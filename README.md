# Nickless Weather Radar

## Description
This site will allow you to search for a city name and it will populate the weather information for this city, along with a 5-day forecast of the next five days.

The site will display the following information for the user:

* Temperature (current temperature and the minimum/maximum for the 5-day forecast)
* Pressure
* Relative humidity
* UV index with color-coding to indicate low (green), medium (yellow), high (orange) and extreme (red)
* Wind speed
* Weather condition

Data will persist if the page is reloaded, with a button added to clear search history both from the page and from local storage. Clicking on a city listed in search history will pull the weather data for that city, without updating the search history.
